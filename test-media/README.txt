These files are here, in this Git submodule, in case there's some copyright
problem — then, can remove those files / commits from this repo, without
affecting the main repo that much.

Also, maybe eventually there'll be fairly many a bit large test files here,
some of which later on aren't needed.  Then can be nice to be able to delete
those files and the commits that added them — i.e. rewrite history, to keep
this repo small.  Without affecting the history of the main repo (it'd just get
a new commit that points to the rewritten history here).
