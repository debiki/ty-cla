that was accepted by Kaj
Magnus Lindberg or Debiki AB (the company behind Talkyard), when the person
signing the CLA did that in an informal way, like, reading it and telling me in
a chat somewhere, that s/he agrees to it. Maybe the chat was private so there's
no public record of the person having agreed to the CLA (e.g. no publicly
visible GitHub commit where the person says "I agree to the CLA" in the commit
message).

By placing such contributions here, if, against all odds, there's some problem
with a contribution, it can be removed, maybe even rewriting the Git history,
without affecting the main Talkyard repo so much (it'd just be updated to link
to the new revision of this ty-translations repo).
